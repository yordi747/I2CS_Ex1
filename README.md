Ex01 - Investigating Polynomials
This project is an assignment in Introduction to Computer Science in Arial university.
The goal is to implement various functions for analyzing and working with polynomials, using arrays and basic algorithmic techniques.

The project demonstrates my understanding of:

Arrays
Functions
Recursive methods
Polynomial operations
Implemented Functions
1. f()
Calculates the value of a polynomial for a given x.

2. root_rec()
Finds a root of the polynomial using a recursive method.

3. polyFromPoints()
Constructs a polynomial from 2 or 3 distinct points.

4. equals()
Checks if two polynomials are identical.

5. poly()
Converts an array representation of a polynomial into a readable string.
Example: {0, 1, 1} → x^2 + 1x + 0.

6. sameValue()
Finds the points where two polynomials intersect.

7. length()
Calculates the length of the polynomial curve between two points.

8. area()
Calculates the area between two polynomials using a Riemann-like integration method.

9. getPolynomFromString()
The opposite of poly():
Takes a polynomial string and converts it into an array
(works only with the exact string format returned by poly()).

10. add()
Adds two polynomials.

11. mul()
Multiplies two polynomials.

12. derivative()
Computes the derivative of a polynomial.

13. mp()
Multiplies the polynomial by a scalar.
